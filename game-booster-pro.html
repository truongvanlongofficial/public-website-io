    <h1>Privacy Policy for Game Booster</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Game Booster ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <h3>1.1 VpnService Usage</h3>
    <p>Our App uses the Android <code>VpnService</code> class. This is a core feature of the App required to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Optimize Network Latency:</strong> We use the VPN interface to prioritize gaming traffic and reduce ping.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS Routing:</strong> We may route your DNS requests to faster, public DNS servers (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare) to improve connection speed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Traffic Logging:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or log any of your network traffic, browsing history, or data transmitted through the VPN tunnel.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All network optimization happens locally on your device. The VPN service does not route your traffic through a remote server owned by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Device Information</h3>
    <p>We access specific device information to provide the "Game Booster" functionality. This data is processed <strong>locally</strong> on your device and is <strong>not</strong> transmitted to our servers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Battery Status:</strong> We access battery level and charging status to display battery usage metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>CPU Temperature:</strong> We access system thermal sensors to monitor and display device temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Latency (Ping):</strong> We ping public servers (e.g., 8.8.8.8) to measure and display your network stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Installed Packages:</strong> We check installed apps to identify games for optimization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>We request the following permissions to provide core features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE & FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE:</strong> To keep the optimization service running while you play games, ensuring consistent performance.</li>
        <li><strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES:</strong> To scan your device for installed games so you can add them to the booster list.</li>
        <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> To show the active status of the booster and performance metrics in the notification shade.</li>
        <li><strong>INTERNET & ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> To measure network latency (ping) and check connection status.</li>
        <li><strong>WAKE_LOCK:</strong> To prevent the device from sleeping while the game booster is active, ensuring uninterrupted gaming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Ads</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
    
    <h3>3.1 Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized ads. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>Location data (if allowed by your device settings)</li>
        <li>Usage data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on how Google uses data, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Google's Privacy & Terms</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
