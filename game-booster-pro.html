        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 11, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Game Booster Pro</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are
            committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy describes the types
            of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use our mobile application (the
            "App") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email, address, or phone
            number directly. However, we use third-party services that may collect information used to identify your
            device to improve app performance and serve relevant ads.</p>

        <h3>A. Device and Other IDs (Collected & Shared)</h3>
        <p>Our app integrates <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>. These services
            automatically collect identifiers such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising ID</strong> (e.g., Google AAID)</li>
            <li><strong>Device ID</strong></li>
            <li><strong>IP Address</strong> (Used for general location inference, not precise GPS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To serve personalized ads that are relevant to your interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> To detect and prevent invalid clicks or bot activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To analyze user demographics and engagement.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We use <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to monitor the stability of Game Booster Pro. This tool
            collects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> Stack traces regarding what caused the app to crash.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Information about your device model, OS version, free storage, and battery
                level at the time of a crash.</li>
            <li><strong>System Resources Monitoring:</strong> The App monitors system resources such as RAM usage, CPU
                temperature, and battery health locally to provide real-time performance stats and trigger optimization
                tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To identify bugs, fix crashes, and ensure the app runs smoothly on your device.</p>

        <h3>C. App Activity (Collected)</h3>
        <p>We collect data on how you interact with our App, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Interactions:</strong> Boost mode usage, game launch frequency, and screen views.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To understand which features are most popular and to optimize the user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>D. Installed Applications Data (Processed Ephemerally)</h3>
        <p>Our App accesses the list of installed applications on your device to provide core gaming optimization
            features.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To identify installed games for the Game Launcher and to detect resource-heavy
                background processes. This allows the App to perform memory cleanup (RAM Boosting) to ensure a maximum
                available RAM for your gaming session.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling:</strong> This data is processed locally on your device and is processed
                <strong>ephemerally</strong>. We do not store this data on our servers nor share your list of installed
                apps with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party service providers. We strongly advise you to review their Privacy Policies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>All data collected by our third-party partners is <strong>encrypted in transit</strong> using secure
            protocols (HTTPS/TLS). We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, but
            remember that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Choices & Opt-Out</h2>
        <p>You can opt-out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Go to Settings > Google > Ads > Tap "Reset advertising ID" or "Delete
                advertising ID".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deleting the Advertising ID will not stop you from seeing ads, but they will be less relevant to you.</p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
            information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>8. VpnService Usage</h2>
        <p>Our App utilizes the Android <strong>VpnService</strong> to provide network optimization features, such as
            the "Network Stabilizer" and "Ping Protection."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> The VpnService creates a local VPN tunnel to optimize game-related data
                packets and reduce latency (ping). It is also used to prevent background applications from consuming
                bandwidth while you are gaming.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> The VPN remains strictly <strong>on your device</strong>. We <strong>do
                    not</strong> collect, log, or store any personal data transmitted through the VPN tunnel. We
                <strong>do not</strong> redirect your internet traffic to a remote server for monitoring or data mining.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> The VPN is only activated when you explicitly start the "Boost" mode, and you
                may disconnect it at any time.</li>
        </ul>
