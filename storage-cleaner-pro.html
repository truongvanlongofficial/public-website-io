    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Storage Analyzer Pro</strong> ("we", "our", or "us"). We are committed to protecting your
        privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our
        mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>1. Core Functionality and "All Files Access" (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)</h2>
        <p>Storage Analyzer Pro is a dedicated storage management and junk cleaning tool. To provide its core
            functionality, the App requires the <strong>"All Files Access" (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)</strong> permission
            on Android 11+ and Read/Write External Storage permissions on older versions.</p>
        <p><strong>Why do we need this permission?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>To comprehensively scan your device's storage for unnecessary files, cache, empty folders, and large
                media files.</li>
            <li>To identify duplicate files and screenshots across multiple directories (including internal storage and
                SD card).</li>
            <li>To allow you to safely delete these junk files to free up storage space.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> This permission is used <u>strictly locally on your device</u>. We do not
            copy, upload, transfer, or share your personal files, photos, videos, or documents with our servers or any
            third parties. The scanning and deletion processes happen entirely offline within your device.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>

    <h3>a. Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any structured personal data such as your name, email address, phone
        number, contacts, location data, or the actual content of your personal files (photos, videos, documents).</p>

    <h3>b. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>The App may automatically collect limited, non-personally identifiable information to ensure the App functions
        correctly, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, OS version, language settings, and device identifiers
            (such as Android Advertising ID).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous statistics about how you interact with the App (e.g., features used,
            buttons clicked) to help us improve user experience and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services (Advertising & Analytics)</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services, such as <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, to display advertisements within the App.
        These services may use technologies like cookies or mobile advertising identifiers to collect non-personal data
        to provide relevant ads and analyze ad performance.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>European Users (GDPR):</strong> If you are located in the EEA or UK, we use Google's User Messaging
            Platform (UMP) to obtain your explicit consent before displaying personalized ads. You can manage your
            consent choices at any time within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>California Users (CCPA):</strong> We comply with CCPA regulations regarding the collection of data
            for advertising purposes.</li>
    </ul>

            href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your data. All file scanning is performed locally on your device. We implement
        reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect the limited anonymous usage data
        we collect against unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will
        delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.</p>
