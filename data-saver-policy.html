        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date: December 31, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>Data Saver Pro</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed
            to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of
            information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use our mobile application (the "App")
            and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Core Functionality Disclosure:</strong> Data Saver Pro uses the Android <strong>VpnService</strong>
            to create a local-only VPN tunnel. This is the main purpose of our App, allowing us to monitor and optimize
            your data usage in real-time. This tunnel operates entirely on your device and <strong>DOES NOT</strong>
            redirect your traffic to any remote servers.
        </div>

        <h2>1. VpnService Requirements & Usage</h2>
        <p>In compliance with the Google Play VpnService Policy, we declare the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To track real-time data consumption per application and provide data saving
                visualizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All network traffic analysis is performed locally on your device. We
                do not inspect, collect, or store the content of your communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> We do not redirect or manipulate user traffic from other apps for monetization
                purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The VPN is only activated after you provide explicit consent by tapping
                the "Start Data Saving" button and accepting the system VPN dialog.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email, address, or phone
            number directly. However, we use third-party services (Google AdMob) that collect information used to
            identify your device to serve relevant ads and monitor app performance.</p>

        <h3>A. Device and Other IDs (Collected & Shared)</h3>
        <p>Our app integrates Google AdMob SDK. This service automatically collects identifiers such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising ID (Google AAID)</li>
            <li>Device ID</li>
            <li>IP Address (Used for general location inference, not precise GPS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To serve personalized ads that are relevant to your interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> To detect and prevent invalid clicks or bot activity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. App Info and Performance (Collected)</h3>
        <p>We monitor the stability of Data Saver Pro through automated diagnostics. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Information about device model, OS version, and app performance logs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To identify bugs, fix crashes, and ensure the app runs smoothly.</p>

        <h3>C. App Activity (Collected)</h3>
        <p>We analyze data on how you interact with our App, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Interactions:</strong> Button clicks, screen views, and feature usage (e.g., Ultra Mode
                activation).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To understand feature popularity and optimize the user experience.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party service providers. We strongly advise you to review their Privacy Policies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms">Google AdMob</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>All data collected by our third-party partners is encrypted in transit using secure protocols (HTTPS/TLS). We
            strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, but remember that no method of
            transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Choices & Opt-Out</h2>
        <p>You can opt-out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:</p>
        <p><strong>Android:</strong> Go to Settings > Google > Ads > Tap "Reset advertising ID" or "Delete advertising
            ID".</p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
            information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
            periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this
            page.</p>
