      <li><strong>Advertising data:</strong> If the app shows ads, AdMob or similar services may collect anonymous identifiers (e.g., advertising ID) for ad personalization and analytics.</li>

      <li>Maintain and analyze usage statistics (anonymously).</li>
    </ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
